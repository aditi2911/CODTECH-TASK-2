## overview of project :TO -DO LIST WEB APPLICATION
This project is a simple and functional To-Do List web application. The HTML structure is designed to create a user-friendly interface with a heading, input field for adding new tasks, buttons for interaction, and filters for task management. The CSS includes links to external stylesheets for icons and custom styling to enhance the visual appeal of the application.

The JavaScript code implements the core functionality of the To-Do List. It begins by selecting necessary DOM elements and retrieving any previously stored tasks from the local storage. The tasks are displayed using the showTodos function, which dynamically updates the task list based on the current filter status (completed or pending) and displays a placeholder image when there are no tasks.

Users can add new tasks by typing into the input field and either pressing the Enter key or clicking the add button. Each task is stored in an array and then in the local storage to persist data between sessions. Tasks can be marked as completed or pending by clicking the checkbox next to each task, which updates their status and style.

The application also allows for task deletion, either individually via a delete button next to each task or collectively using a "Delete All" button. Filters enable users to view only completed or pending tasks by toggling the active status on filter buttons.

Overall, this project provides a comprehensive example of a basic To-Do List application, demonstrating key web development skills including DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage management.
